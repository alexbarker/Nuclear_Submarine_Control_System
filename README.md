# Nuclear_Submarine_Control_System
Development of a Control System for a Nuclear Submarine

A control system was designed and implemented using Ada-SPARK to include the following subsystem controls: operational status, airlock doors, airlock locks, life support levels, nuclear reactor temperature levels, diving depth levels and torpedo storing, loading and firing. The control system meets the requirements specification of the nuclear submarine and achieved a SPARK level of Gold. The system outputs a series of tests and conditions to a console where control system statuses and warnings are displayed so the user can determine if the system is operating safely.

- The nuclear submarine must operate under the following conditions:

- The submarine must have at least one airlock door closed at all times.

- The submarine must have at least one airlock door closed at all times.

- If the oxygen runs out, the submarine has to surface.

- If the reactor overheats, the submarine has to surface.

- If the oxygen runs low, a warning must be shown.

- The submarine canâ€™t dive beneath a certain depth.

- The submarine must be capable of storing, loading and ring torpedoes safely.

To ensure the nuclear submarine operates according to the above specification, an application using the Ada programming language was created following the SPARK method of formal proofing. The control system meets the requirements specification of the nuclear submarine and achieved a SPARK level of Gold. The system outputs a series of tests and conditions to a console where control system statuses and warnings are displayed so the user can determine if the system is operating safely.
