# Nuclear_Submarine_Control_System
Development of a Control System for a Nuclear Submarine

A control system was designed and implemented using Ada-SPARK to include the following subsystem controls: operational status, airlock doors, airlock locks, life support levels, nuclear reactor temperature levels, diving depth levels and torpedo storing, loading and firing. The control system meets the requirements specification of the nuclear submarine and achieved a SPARK level of Gold. The system outputs a series of tests and conditions to a console where control system statuses and warnings are displayed so the user can determine if the system is operating safely.
